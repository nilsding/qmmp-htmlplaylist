# qmmp-htmlplaylist

A plug-in for [Qmmp](http://qmmp.ylsoftware.com/) that exports your playlist to
a HTML file.

The generated HTML file looks (and almost smells) like it was generated by
Winamp.

## Installation

1. Install the Qt and Qmmp development packages (the latter is called
   `libqmmp-devel` on openSUSE)
2. Run `qmake-qt5 .` in this directory
3. Build the plug-in: `make -j9`
4. Install the plug-in: `make install` (or just move the built
   `libhtmlplaylist.so` to e.g. `/usr/lib64/qmmp-1.4/General/`)

## Usage

Start Qmmp, go to the settings, and enable the `HTML playlist generator` plug-in
(listed in _General_).

Then right click in the playlist and select _Actions_ â†’ _Generate HTML playlist_
from the context menu to generate the HTML playlist.  You can also press
`Ctrl+Alt+G` instead of navigating through the menu ;-).

When it finished generating (it does not take very long), your default browser
(or whatever application is associated with `text/html` files for you, probably
Wine Internet Explorer) should open a new page with the exported playlist.

Save that file somewhere on your webspace and brag about your music taste.
